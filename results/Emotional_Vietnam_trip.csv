Emotional Vietnam trip,"This scene happened so fast, but it stayed with me longer than I expected. Everyone around us gave more than the camera could capture, and that made everything feel real. I hope you can feel a bit of that, too.","BANG CHAN.

Emotional Vietnam trip,"I wasn't in a good mental space for a while so I ran away to Thailand to try and get an emotional reset.
It was rough; I almost didn't go and wanted to stay in bed.
My shoulders and feet ached and I got lost.
But forcing myself out of my comfort zone was necessary.","Erna Mahyuni
