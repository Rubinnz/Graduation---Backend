How I felt in Vietnam,"My dad was a Vietnam Veteran who lost his battle with PTSD. When he deplaned  with his brothers in arms, they dropped to their knees, kissed the soil in gratitude anguish. Protesters threw rotten vegetation, screamed & waved signs.

How I felt in Vietnam,Written by a 19 year old combat medic during the Vietnam war. How poignant that he wrote this to his parents before he died. He wanted them to know.

How I felt in Vietnam,I have known true honest journalism was dead for years. In the late '60s the Vietnam War reporting. was all over the map for the same event.

How I felt in Vietnam,Was talking hog sb at a fall ball series with an older guy (vietnam vet). We were talking about how good bri is and he felt it was necessary to throw in that he loved tall athletic women and that anyone would be lucky to date her. I was very uncomfortable,"tookie

How I felt in Vietnam,"I feel sorry! But this is a war! Have you an idea how many such children in Vietnam, Iraq, and Yugoslavia felt like this poor girl? Do you hate USA for that?","𝚂𝚗𝚘𝚠 𝙳𝚘𝚗

How I felt in Vietnam,"Bet you didn’t know he was fighting communism while we sent millions to Lenin and Stalin? Then we go into Vietnam in the name of fighting communism years later. Make it make sense. Also ask Jesse Owens how he felt about Hitler vs Roosevelt. Another lie. Jew here, but I hate lies.","Cleo Mcdowell

How I felt in Vietnam,"An American Twitch streamer who’s from Detroit, living in Vietnam. He answered a trumptard who asked how he felt about trump’s win, very passive aggressively, “Oh yea! The new US President will be a convicted felon. I feel real badass, man (using a macho voice) Real badass.”","Elizabeth

How I felt in Vietnam,"Er, Juanita, are you aware of what happened to us in Vietnam, or of what happened when we came home?
How about ""Happy 79th Birthday, President Trump!"", the only man that I've ever felt compelled to vote for?","GERALD FARIS

How I felt in Vietnam,Imagine how the tunnel rats in Vietnam felt. I could never do it either. I’m just not made for that type of claustrophobia.,"markgordonX

How I felt in Vietnam,"I went to Vietnam a month ago, but I can barely remember how it all felt, even though it was the most beautiful experience. 

However, I can clearly remember all the inconvenience I had when I was stranded in the rain outside a bus station.","Vikrant S. Ghatkar

How I felt in Vietnam,"How soon after this, did the school switch to color photos.  I always felt so ripped off. Also, our senior pictures weren't in fancy locations like kids today.","#MAGA Vietnam Veteran

How I felt in Vietnam,Right on point when I saw the set leak of him in the punisher outfit I  already felt iffy on born again but so many great characters got I even often think about nuke and how he was made a cop instead a Vietnam vet,"treeboi 73

How I felt in Vietnam,and it took years of therapy with Veteran doctors too. At BAMC I had a Doc that was in Vietnam and I was lucky enough to be seen by him. I can't remember his name but he helped me more than any one because he knew exactly how I felt and could help me understand my own mind,"Christopher Turner

How I felt in Vietnam,"The varying composition of the video has importance with unintentional cues as sound, subconscious choices, and how long I let the idea sit. (Previously I wanted to show 'made in Vietnam' on board). As I lift my hand, I felt the shadows be the aliens; the bears be the astronauts.","Jaijet Quezon (Jackie)

How I felt in Vietnam,"I never knew Lucas modeled the rebels off of Vietnam, cheers for that tidbit. It changes nothing about how I feel, either how I felt about the original when I first viewed it nor about my attitude to entertainment today.

In fact it reinforces my point that I don't want to be","Michael Cook
