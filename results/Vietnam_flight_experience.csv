Vietnam flight experience,"I gifted the cabin crew small goodie bags during the holidays because everyone deserves cheer. Unexpectedly, they returned the kindness and treated me like one of their own during my 14 hours long flight. They ensured I was eating and that I was comfortable. We were like family.","Lee Huynh
