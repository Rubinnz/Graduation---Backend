Pho Vietnam review,"Oh oh I talked about it with other Vietnamese dragoons in replies and it’s the camera angle/filters that made it look like the noodles are rounder, I also added extra toppings with cha. I thought I got tricked earlier cause I ordered from the pho menu but just bad photo","Doki

Pho Vietnam review,"I miss phở so much. The steaming bowl of broth and rice noodles, the claustrophobic seating, the order form you fill out yourself, the Sriracha and hoisin, mint and bean sprouts, even the rickety tables still moist with bleach. And the strangers. I miss being among them.","Tai Huynh
