Ninh Binh travel review,จากใจคนอยู่สามเดือน จริงๆคือมันเป็นเมือง slow life มากกกกกก สวนสาธารณะเยอะ พื้นที่สีเขียวเยอะ นี่ชอบไป china town มาก อาหารแปลกใหม่และอร่อยเยอะอยู่ แต่ถ้าพูดในเรื่องความบันเทิงใดๆก็อาจจะน่าเบื่อ เพราะมันไม่มีไรจริงๆ เวลาวันหยุดนี่ก็ไปแต่ห้าง พวกแบรนด์ขนมแบรนด์อาหารอร่อยๆก็เยอะนะ,"แม่น้องโรม (tired)

Ninh Binh travel review,自分も一度行き、建物や展示はまあ楽しめましたしね。ベトナムの水上人形劇とかよかったですよ。あと１、２回は行くつもり。ただそのことと、あれだけ大風呂敷広げ、政治利用し、コスト増なども強引に押し切ってきた事業を「意外と人気やし、まあええか」とはなりませんね。,"松本創
