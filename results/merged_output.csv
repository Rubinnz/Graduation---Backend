Banh mi Vietnam review,"อยากจะบอกคนที่จะไปว่า 
- อากาศร้อนมาก แนะนำให้ใส่ชุดสบายๆ แต่ใครจะแต่งตรีมหรูหราก็ตามแต่สะดวก
- น้ำจิ้มอร่อยมาก
- ใครไปต้องกินหมี่หยกเป็ดย่าง อร่อยมาก แต่อย่ากินเยอะเพราะเอียน 
- กุ้งสด 
- อาหารทะเลดี

Hoi An travel,예약은 여기서 가능. 일행이 있을 경우 택시 이동이 더 나을 수 있지만 혼여 여행객들은 택시 이동이 부담되므로 셔틀 이용하는게 더 저렴. 하지만 호이안 셔틀 정류장이 두 군데 밖에 없으므로 숙소가 정류장에서 멀면 택시 이동이 더 낫다.,"박정희

Hue travel review,เวลาดูทริปคู่หรือทริปสามหนุ่มแล้วให้ความรู้สึกสบายใจ น่าจะเพราะพวกฮีมีไวบ์ที่กลมกลืนกัน บุคลิก ทัศนคติ เสียงพูดโทนนุ่มๆ ความสุภาพอ่อนโยน ความสนใจและ lifestyle ใกล้ๆกัน บางทีมีฟีลให้ลุ้นเอาใจช่วย ใจฟูกับความใจดีของคนในพื้นที่ มีความออแกนิค ผิดพลาดไปก็ขำๆ ไม่มีใครกลายเป็นตัวตลก,"LaughLiveLove

Vietnam Airbnb review,"傍晚散步的路上突然看到高級美景，原來是民宿特別打造過的庭園。雖然景致宜人但是充斥我叫小孩不要亂跑的聲音。
晚餐在光看外觀不敢走進的越南小吃點三杯魷魚、菜脯蛋、鹹豬肉、高麗菜和菠菜、蛤蜊湯，每道都有夠好吃。
貓又可愛不怕人。

夜景為今天地母生日，白天超絕大塞車所以晚餐後再去點香賀壽。","打字機阿伯
