Halong Bay travel,จากใจคนอยู่สามเดือน จริงๆคือมันเป็นเมือง slow life มากกกกกก สวนสาธารณะเยอะ พื้นที่สีเขียวเยอะ นี่ชอบไป china town มาก อาหารแปลกใหม่และอร่อยเยอะอยู่ แต่ถ้าพูดในเรื่องความบันเทิงใดๆก็อาจจะน่าเบื่อ เพราะมันไม่มีไรจริงๆ เวลาวันหยุดนี่ก็ไปแต่ห้าง พวกแบรนด์ขนมแบรนด์อาหารอร่อยๆก็เยอะนะ,"แม่น้องโรม (tired)

Halong Bay travel,"Yeah. Private is the way to do it. You get too many loud backpackers on the public ones.

But it is lovely.  

You can get a two day slow boat similar to yours from Chiang Khong in Thailand down to Luang Prabang with a nights stop over in Pak Beng and it's lovely.","Barking Mad

Halong Bay travel,ส่วนตัวชอบมากค่ะ เหมือนจะเล็ก แต่ 3 วันยังเที่ยวไม่เต็มอิ่มเลย รถเมล์รอเป็นเวลา นานหน่อยแต่ก็ซึมซับบรรยากาศค่ะ นั่งกระเช้าไปกลับไรงี้ ถ้าสนใจเกี่ยวกับเมืองจำลองของชนเผ่าในไต้หวันหรือสวนสนุกก็นั่งกระเช้าต่อเข้าไปเลยได้ค่ะ,"Little ship แต่หายมาก
