Thinking about visiting Vietnam,"I had a lesson with a student from Vietnam. I was really happy because I love Vietnam. When I visited there last year, I had a very good time strolling around the city, enjoying scrumptious cuisine and riding a motorcycle!
Now I'm thinking about visiting there again this year.","Yuya@EnglishWD

Thinking about visiting Vietnam,"First went 1977 aged 10, 1-1 draw against Blackburn. I've been close to 500 times including home/ away /Europe. But I met a guy from Vietnam, visiting for the first time and had a beer with him, always brings a smile thinking about the look of excitement on his face GGMU.","Anthony Bennett

Thinking about visiting Vietnam,"Last night of a fantastic 10 day break in Vietnam tonight, having travelled from HCM to Hanoi and back again. A truly fascinating country. Having learnt about the war at school I naively didn’t realise quite how much beautiful scenery etc there is to explore too.","Ed Banthorp

Thinking about visiting Vietnam,"It has a capitalist economy, with less regulation than in most Western countries. Lots of poor people still, many of them exploited through human trafficking. The only thing that is ""socialist"" about Vietnam is that there's a single party rule that you can't remove legally.","stimmtdochgarnicht

Thinking about visiting Vietnam,"Don't, visit the countryside instead. But, if you came for the food, look for the ""smaller"" cities in the deltas. For the looks, Hạ Long ig.","NhanTNT • hi :3 • голубых небес навес

Thinking about visiting Vietnam,"I'm also thinking to visit, I think Asia is a place for me. I am thinking to visit Japan again before visiting Vietnam. I've studied very little about Vietnam but I want to know how this company can give me more information, although they're the company so they can say anything","Michael Larsen
