Saigon travel review,"You gotta do quang si waterfall and the bear refuge. You can get a decent tuk tuk in the city center, theres also vans who will take you just find the guys standing at the corner where the night market is, or near joma cafe.

Also saffron coffee is a must for daytime chill","Snowkid

Saigon travel review,I acc can’t believe me and my gf met a random man on an alleyway of Khao San Rd and booked a full day tour with him. Next day his friend actually shows up to pick us up cause the original guy got too drunk and we basically had a private driver for half of the day for only £23,"$KINNYLEGEND

Saigon travel review,"You mean it's a lot worse? 

Of course I'm aware as a tourist I'm not really seeing ""the real singapore"" it just always seemed to have a lot of green space, you can walk if you don't mind the heat, there was cheap kind of healthy food if you look for it

honestly very interesting","latlonging

Saigon travel review,From what I have seen it caters to my desires while understanding it's not Japan (not even close).   Did you start in Saigon or Hanoi?   Did you go to Ha Long Bay from Hanoi?,"Dr Juan Medina

It’s like stepping back in time in parts of Saigon and danang.  Helicopter hangers still there, tunnels, museums.   Super interesting history.","Democracy Fan Boy

Saigon travel review,"Yeah it's not that good as a city now that's true. Not compared to Luang Prabang. But to be fair it was razed to the ground and completely depopulated in 1828. It pretty much ceased to exist for a few decades, leading to it not really having the cultural heart of other capitals.","A Kiwi in Siam

Saigon travel review,"Thinh anh kitchen, and Saigon Deli, best spots in town. Saigon Deli has better fresh rolls and Banh Mi and my opinon but Thinh Anh is virtually neck and neck. Easier to eat in at Thinh Anh, but Saigons Viet Coffee is authentic and strong","Lucrative Lu

Saigon travel review,"well as comic relief but lack memorable individual moments.

 Direction & Tone:
 The film uses Vietnam like a Pinterest board of romance — dreamy streets, cozy cafes, night lamps, ocean winds .
 Beautiful visuals but sometimes prioritized style over emotional logic.1","CriticQ | Cinema Insider

Saigon travel review,"That's why I said, the centre. Out west is ok, the shore is ok. The city centre is a dangerous hole.
None of it has the throbbing heartbeat and vibrancy of Saigon. That's all the way from district 1 to district 10.
It's living and breathing and a pleasure to walk the streets.","Irn Boru

Saigon travel review,อาหารทัวร์จัดให้ซ้ำหลายมื้อไปหน่อย แต่ก็กินได้แหละ ห้องน้ำไม่ซัฟเฟอร์มากเพราะจิตแข็ง (ไปญี่ปุ่นเคยแรนด้อมเจอที่อุบาดๆ เหมือนกัน) บุหรี่ไม่แย่เท่าตอนไปเวียดนาม ส่วนอย่างอื่นไม่รู้เพราะ 60% ของทริปใช้ชีวิตบนรถ ...,"CHA
