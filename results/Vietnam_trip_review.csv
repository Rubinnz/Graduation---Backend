Vietnam trip review,"4 วัน 3 คืน in Vietnam 
ขอบคุณอิงฟ้า - ชาล็อตที่เป็นแรงจูงใจพาพวกเราไปตปทด้วยกันครั้งแรก ขอบคุณเพื่อนๆ ในกลุ่มที่ซัพพอร์ตกันทั้งทริป ช่วยกันคิดเงิน แปลงค่าเงินดองเป็นเงินบาท ช่วยกันเรียกแกรป ช่วยกันหาร้านข้าว หาร้านอะไรอร่อยๆ กิน พากันเดินรอบเมืองแบบไปไหนไปกันจนขาลาก","°¯`••´¯° (𝕊𝕞𝕚𝕝𝕖𝕪)

Vietnam trip review,"รีวิวเวียดนาม - แฟนมีตตปทครั้งแรกของหยิ่นวอร์

- อากาศในเวียดนามร้อนมาก และอาหารอร่อยดี แม้ว่าต้องเดินหากันหน่อย
- เพื่อนเวียดนาม น่ารักดี พยายามพูดภาษาไทย และก็พยายามช่วยเหลือตลอด
- สถานที่เที่ยวก็ใกล้ๆกันหมด (จริงๆอยากออกไปไกลๆแต่ไม่มีเวลา) (1)","Double B {warwanarat}
